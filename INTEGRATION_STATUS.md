## 🔄 PENDING PHASES

### Phase 6: Execute Content Creation (Waiting for you)
**What you need to do:**
1. Add the 5 schema files from `sanity-studio-setup.md` to your Sanity Studio
2. Deploy schemas: `sanity deploy`
3. Get auth token from https://sanity.io/manage (API → Tokens → Editor permissions)
4. Add `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token` to `.env`
5. Run: `node create-initial-content.js`

### Phase 8: Final Verification (After content creation)
- Build verification
- Live CMS data testing
- Deployment readiness check

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS

**Marketing App**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- Running at: http://localhost:5173
- Using static fallback content
- Ready for CMS integration

**Sanity Integration**: ⏳ **READY FOR SCHEMA DEPLOYMENT** 
- Connection: ✅ Working
- Schemas: 📝 Prepared (need manual deployment)
- Content: ⏳ Waiting for schema deployment

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Deploy schemas to your Sanity Studio** (15 minutes)
   - Follow `sanity-studio-setup.md`
   
2. **Create initial content** (5 minutes)
   - Follow `setup-auth-token.md`
   - Run `node create-initial-content.js`

3. **Verify live integration** (5 minutes)
   - Check that marketing app switches to CMS data
   - Run final verification

## 📋 VERIFICATION COMMANDS

```bash
# Check current schema status
node check-schemas.js

# Test CMS integration
node test-current-integration.js

# Create content (after schema deployment)
node create-initial-content.js

# Start marketing app
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 ROLLBACK PLAN

If anything goes wrong:
1. Remove/comment out Sanity env vars in `.env`
2. Marketing app will revert to static fallback content
3. No existing Sanity content will be affected

**Ready for the next step when you are!** The heavy lifting is done - just need the manual schema deployment in your Sanity Studio.
