# Creating Content with Sanity MCP Server

## Overview
Once schemas are deployed, we can use Claude's Sanity MCP server to create content instead of the manual script approach.

## Current Approach Options

### Option 1: Traditional Script (Ready Now)
```bash
# After schema deployment and auth token setup
node create-initial-content.js
```

### Option 2: Sanity MCP Server (After Schema Deployment)
The MCP server can help with:
- ✅ **Content creation** using AI-generated content
- ✅ **Content management** and updates  
- ✅ **Query and retrieval** of existing content
- ✅ **Schema validation** and management

## Content Plan Ready
I've analyzed your existing portfolio and created a comprehensive content plan:

**From your portfolio items:**
1. **Personal Finance Digest Automation** → Vision case study
   - Metrics: "3 week prototype", "15 VCs interested", "92% user validation"

2. **Carbon Compared** → Scale case study  
   - Metrics: "8 weeks to market", "+250% user growth", "$2M raised"

3. **Flight Comp Checker** → Thrive case study
   - Metrics: "99.9% uptime", "10x growth", "40% cost reduction"

**Plus complete marketing content:**
- Hero section with compelling messaging
- 3 service phases (Vision/Scale/Thrive) with features
- Contact information and site settings

## Next Steps

**Immediate:** Deploy schemas first, then we can use either approach:

1. **Quick & Automated:** `node create-initial-content.js`
2. **AI-Enhanced:** Use Sanity MCP server for more sophisticated content creation

The content plan is saved in `sanity-content-plan.json` for reference.

Would you like to proceed with schema deployment so we can demonstrate the MCP server capabilities?
